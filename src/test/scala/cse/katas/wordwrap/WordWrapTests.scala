/**
  * Test-drive a function to accept a string and a line length, and return a version of the original string, possibly with
  *newline characters inserted, such that no line in the resulting string is longer than the supplied line length.
 **
 Wherever possible, newlines should be inserted between words; they should be placed inside words only when those
  *words are themselves longer than the permitted line length.
 **
 For the initial cut of this kata:
 *
 * Assume that the input will contain only spaces to separate words: no tabs, no newlines, no form feeds, and hyphens
  *are considered to be part of the words they're embedded in.
  * Assume that words will be separated by only one space: no multiple consecutive spaces.
